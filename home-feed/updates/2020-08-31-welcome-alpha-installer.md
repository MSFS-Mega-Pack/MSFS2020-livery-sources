Thanks for using the livery installer! This is a project worked on by a small group of people to make your Flight Simulator experience that _little_ bit better.

Our aim is to make an open source utility for all your flight simming needs, starting by creating an installer for the well known livery megapack, started by Clink and contributed to by way too many people to name here.
