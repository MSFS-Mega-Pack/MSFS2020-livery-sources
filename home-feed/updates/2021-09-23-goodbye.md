Hey everyone!

As per the announced Project Mega Pack shutdown, the Manager will now longer be available for downloading new aircraft liveries.

Existing aircraft can still be viewed and deleted through the Manager. It is likely that this application will no longer receive any updates, so we recommend you uninstall it.

A huge thanks goes to everyone who has used this livery manager over the past year. It's been a great ride, and we hope you've enjoyed it!

The entire manager application, API and data sources are [completely public on GitHub](https://github.com/MSFS-Mega-Pack), so feel free to take a peek. Also public are our [A330-300 and A321 projects](https://github.com/Project-Mega-Pack).

Keep in touch by joining [Clink123's public Discord server](https://discord.gg/gsMTu3q).

See you online,
