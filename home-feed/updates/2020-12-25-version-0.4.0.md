Merry Christmas! üéÑüéÅ

Version 0.4.0 of the Megapack Manager is here! This update almost fully focuses on internationalisation support. This means the manager can be translated into different languages (yes, even yours!).

**To change your language, click 'Settings' at the top, then click the second dropdown, and choose your language.**

We've got **5 different languages** so far (excluding English US and UK): Swedish, Dutch, German, Italian, and Simplified Chinese. Traditional Chinese is almost ready, too!

**Want to translate the manager to your own language?** [Check out this guide.](https://github.com/MSFS-Mega-Pack/MSFS2020-livery-manager/tree/main/src/locales#readme)
