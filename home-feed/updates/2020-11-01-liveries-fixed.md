All liveries have now been fixed in the manager, and the standard drag and drop ZIP package.

You can now select any livery you want with no issues.

If you have any other liveries which haven't been fixed, you can fix them with our Livery Upgrade Kit, found in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/megapack).

Thank you for your patience!
