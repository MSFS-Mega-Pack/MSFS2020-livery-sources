The latest patch for flight simulator is here. Woohoo.

Also, boohoo. A lot of the liveries do not work in the latest update as Asobo have done something which made everything break.

We're trying our best to work out what's going on, but in the meantime, please follow the official [Liveries Mega Pack Discord server](https://discord.gg/megapack) to stay up-to-date on any new developments.

Sorry!
