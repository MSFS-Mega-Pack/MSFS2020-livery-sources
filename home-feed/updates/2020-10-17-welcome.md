# Using the livery manager

**To install liveries**, head to the **Available Liveries** tab. You can see all the aircraft which have liveries available. Click any one of these to show its available liveries. You can scroll through the list of liveries, then select the ones you wish to install, then click the floating button in the bottom right to begin installation.

**To update liveries**, please wait for us to implement this feature.

**To remove liveries**, head to the **Installed Liveries** tab, and click and hold the trash icon next to the livery you no longer want.
